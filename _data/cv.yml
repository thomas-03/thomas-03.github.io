        - During undergraduate I double-majored in Computer Science and Astrophysics. 
        - title: Beyond Boundaries Program.
          contents: 
            - The Beyond Boundaries program is an incredibly competitive interdisciplinary program where I have the opportunity to explore lots of other fields such as business and politics while pursuing me degree. 
            - It focuses on examining the intersection of different fields and creating an interdisciplinary mindset that I can apply to future learning or jobs.
