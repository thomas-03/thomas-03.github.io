Hello! I'm Tegan Thomas, a current 4th-year undergraduate at Washington University in St. Louis. I am double majoring in Computer Science and Astrophysics and am also part of the Beyond Boundaries program. Additionally, I am currently applying to graduate and post-bacc programs in both Physics and Astronomy so if you are accepting graduate students or are interested in working together even for a shorter time period please feel free to reach out! 

I'm particularly passionate about computational astrophysics research, with a current focus on compact objects such as super massive black holes (SMBHs) and neutron stars. Most of my research has been focused on simulations of different astrophysical phenomen, however I'm also interested in learning more about the observational, data-science side of things!

In my free time I like to crochet and hula-hoop. I also love spending time with my friends and family including my two younger sisters Leela and Elliot.
