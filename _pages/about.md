Hello! I'm Tegan Thomas, an incoming Astronomy graduate student at University of Virginia. I spent my undergraduate years at Washington University in St. Louis, where I earned a B.S. in Computer Science with a second major in Astrophysics. I also was part of the Beyond Boundaries program. 

I'm particularly passionate about computational astrophysics research, with a current focus on compact objects such as super massive black holes (SMBHs) and neutron stars. Most of my research has been focused on simulations of different astrophysical phenomena, however I'm also interested in learning more about the observational, data-science side of things!

In my free time I like to crochet and hula-hoop. I also love spending time with my friends and family including my two younger sisters Leela and Elliot.
