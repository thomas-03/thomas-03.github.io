title: Observational Characteristics of Near-Maximal Spin
description: With Dr. Angelo Ricarte as part of the NSBP/SAO EHT Scholars Program I am working on a project identifying observational characteristics of near-maximal spin within EHT observations.

Supermassive black holes (SMBHs) often lie at the center of galaxies, and as they grow they modulate the evolution of their host galaxies via radiation and jet-driven feedback. Both of these processes evolve strongly with black hole spin, making it a key area of interest.

The upper limit on spin due to torque from outgoing radiation is the near-maximal value of 0.998 (as shown in Thorne 1974). However, even stronger limits have been proposed due to magnetic fields, including a commonly adopted maximum of 0.9375 (Gammie et al. 2004). With EHT we can now test these limits! Alongside my co-authors Angelo Ricarte, Ben Prather, and Hyerin Cho, I ran simulations at both spin values in search of observable differences inÂ polarized morphology and feedback efficiency.

    Caption photos easily. On the left, a road goes through a tunnel. Middle, leaves artistically fall in a hipster photoshoot. Right, in another hipster photoshoot, a lumberjack grasps a handful of pine needles.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, _bled_ for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.

<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>

The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}

```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
  <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
  <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
    {% include figure.liquid path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
  </div>
</div>
```

{% endraw %}
